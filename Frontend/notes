Pages and Components
Home Page

Components:
EventList: Displays a list of upcoming events.
EventCard: Shows brief details of each event.
SearchBar: Allows users to search for events.
Event Details Page

ProtectedRoute: Wrapper to protect routes that require authentication.
How It Works
User Authentication

Users can sign up and log in.
Upon logging in, users receive a JWT token for authentication.
Protected routes (e.g., booking an event, accessing the user dashboard) check for a valid JWT token.
Browsing and Booking Events

Users can browse a list of events on the home page.
Clicking on an event card navigates to the event details page.
On the event details page, users can fill out a booking form to book tickets.
The booking form sends a request to the backend to create a booking record.
Managing Events and Bookings (Admin)

Admin users have access to the admin dashboard.
Admins can create new events, update existing events, and delete events.
Admins can view and manage all bookings and users.
User Dashboard

Logged-in users can access their dashboard.
Users can view their profile and update their information.
Users can see a list of their bookings and cancel them if needed.
Backend (Express.js)
Routes:

Auth Routes: Sign up, log in, and verify user.
Event Routes: CRUD operations for events.
Booking Routes: Create and manage bookings.
User Routes: Manage user profiles and admin functionalities.
Models:

User: Stores user information and roles.
Event: Stores event details.
Booking: Stores booking details linked to users and events.
Frontend (React.js)
State Management: Using context API or Redux for managing global state (e.g., user authentication state).
React Router: For navigating between different pages.
Material-UI: For consistent and responsive UI components.
Learning Opportunities
Authentication and Authorization: Implementing secure login and access control.
CRUD Operations: Creating, reading, updating, and deleting events and bookings.
State Management: Efficiently managing application state.
UI/UX Design: Designing user-friendly interfaces.
Full-Stack Integration: Connecting frontend and backend.
This project not only covers fundamental aspects of a MERN stack application but also provides practical experience with common features in real-world applications.
